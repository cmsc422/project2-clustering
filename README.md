# CMSC422 - Project 2 - Clustering

**Due: Oct 15**

In this project, we will work with PCA and K-Means.

As usual, we expect you to complete the notebooks in this homework
and fill in the missing implementations.

Please do not edit function names or parameters as your code will be tested
using a test harness.
